# Week 13: Why businesses support opensource
Hi! This is my week thirteen blog post for Open Source Software Development! :) It's still ongoing, but I wanted to create the file and write down the prompts for easier editing later

## Riju Khatri Talk
This week Riju Khatri, an NYU graduate student came to talk about her experience in OS as well as CS in general. 
- subscribed to newsletters for opensource
communities she picked:
- fedora
    - was able to find a mentor
    - was unfortunately too busy with school and lost contact ;-;
- openstack
- mozilla

She would have low moments
- attached to code
- seeing her pull requests accepted and having others use it kept her going
- opensource was about how others are passionate which was far more satisfying than her work at blackrock

Benefits of opensource
- looks great on resumes :)
- adds to your confidence
- makes people curious
- speaks about your passion for tech
- you get to network with great minds across the globe

use software for a month
look through documentation
start with small bugs
get involved with community 
show your willingness to contribute

- nice to hear she was doing more personal projects while working at blackrock

## Update on finals
