# Week 10: How business models use opensource and an update on finals 
Hi! This is my week ten blog post for Open Source Software Development! :)

## Business models around opensource
I hope this isn't too redundant, but I feel each week I learn more about just how prominent opensource practices are within software development. As I mentioned previously one of the biggest things I've learned in this class was how strong the inherent strengths of open source are as well as how often it's used, but even then one of the things that really surprised me about the readings was the fact that it's not only used in 64% of companies, but is predicted to become used far more going into the future. With what we've learned throughout the year, I'm not surprised that it's commonly used in general, but in companies where there's a greater concern for profit

## Udate on final project
For our midterm we had to fill out reflections on our thoughts about open source and its effects in different departments (ie. why a nonprofit might use it). Alot of the things discussed were things I've mentioned quite alot in my previous blog posts so I don't want to sound too redundant, but I do feel this class has really shown me just how prevalant open source practices are within the world, and just how strong it is. I'm really glad I'm able to take this class not only to learn learn about open source, but because it's the first CS class I've taken that's so collaborative. I really enjoy the more discussion based lessons we have in comparison to the more typical lectures!
