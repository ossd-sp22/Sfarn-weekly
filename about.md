Hi I'm Stephanie Farn! I'm a senior majoring in Game Design and minoring in ComSci.

### More Information

Besides coding, I really enjoy playing the piano and drawing (character design in particular). It's hard for me to pick a favorite game, but I certainly have played Splatoon, Fire Emblem, and Genshin far too much :)
